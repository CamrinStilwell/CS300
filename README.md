1: What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that was being solved in these projects was first writing pseudocode for each of the three data structures (vector, hash table, and tree) that can print a list of all the Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order and for a given course, print the title and prerequisites. The second is implementing a menu where the user can input a menu option to perform an action the program will go through. The third was to solve which data structure had the best run-time, use of memory, advantages, disadvantages, and personal recommendation based on the information collected to use for the actual coding of the program. Lastly, coding the program with features includes:
Loading the data structure.
Printing the course list.
Printing a course.
Exiting the program. 

2: How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach this problem, I had to make sure what each data structure is and what they can do to a file that houses a list of courses. They need to break down the course information by course title and prerequisites. Through previous assignments and correcting mistakes that were mentioned, I was able to clean up the pseudocode, keeping each data structure pseudocode consistent and organized for the final project. I also had to consider how each data structure would have to find a course in the list. This would reflect run-time and how much memory it would take.
This understanding of data structures allowed the final code to use a reliable data structure to find the correct course, organize the list of courses, and print the needed information due to better performance. 

3: How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The roadblocks I encountered while going through the activities were time management and needing the correct layout to print anything in the programs. Time management was heavily affected by real-life scenarios, but I did my best and still turned in what I could even if it didn't run correctly, as I could reflect on what was wrong with the program to make sure to avoid it the next program assignment. The more practice with assignments that included programming, the better I could prevent problems and reflect on the new issues I encountered in the recent assignments.

4: How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by accepting mistakes, going back to fix these mistakes for myself, and understanding what I can do to improve for future work. It's better to learn and work from something, even if it's unfinished than nothing. 

5: How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Work on this project evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by having consistency, being able to go back and reflect on what can be improved, and making sure I understand why and how something functions the way it does, such as the data structures.
